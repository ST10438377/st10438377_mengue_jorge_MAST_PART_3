I am submitting my latest project for your review. I want to highlight that Iâ€™ve updated the style and added more details to the FilterMenu. Additionally, I have made enhancements to the AddMenu, where you can now add dishes, along with their descriptions and prices. You also have the option to remove dishes and save your changes. All the dishes you add will be displayed in the FilterMenu.
